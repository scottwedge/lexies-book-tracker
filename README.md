# lexies-book-tracker

This repo has the source code for my book tracker, which is hosted at <https://books.alexwlchan.net/>.
I use it to keep lists of:

*   Books I've read (and any notes/reviews)
*   Books I'm currently reading
*   Books I want to read (and why I want to read them)

It's a Python app that uses Flask as the web server, plus a handful of other useful libraries.
I don't expect anybody else to use this app directly ‚Äì it's tailored to how I like to organise my books, and unless you're exactly like me you'll probably find my design decisions annoying.
You might find some useful bits in the code, which you're welcome to copy into your own projects.

It was inspired by a <a href="http://tessa-books.glitch.me">similar book tracker</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/tessthornton">Tessa Thornton</a>.

<h2 id="organise">How I organise my books</h2>

For a long time I used Goodreads to organise my books, but I didn't like shoe-horning my book lists into their organisation system.

If I was designing my ideal book tracker, I'd have three lists:

*   **What I've read.**
    I might write a couple of sentences about the book -- possibly a review, possibly just some notes (so I don't love that Goodreads describes this as "review").

    I find 5-star ratings have two many options, so here there are just three:

    *   I loved it! üòç
    *   I didn‚Äôt finish üòî
    *   Neither of the above

*   **What I'm reading right now.**

*   **What I want to read.**
    Within this list, I like to keep notes about the book.
    Why do I want to read it?
    Was it recommended to me, and if so, by who?
    (So I can thank them later.)
    Do I own a copy, or know where I can borrow a copy from?

When I saw Tessa's app, I decided to have a go at taking that idea, and building my own spin on it, but with these lists.

I can search for books, add them to one of these lists, then move a book between lists.
For example, on the "what I want to read" page, there are buttons to mark a book as currently reading or as read.



<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

There are plenty of hosted sites that do this sort of tracking, including Goodreads, Litsy and LibraryThing.

If you want to manage your lists yourself, a good spreadsheet will get you 90% of the functionality of this app.



<h2 id="installation">Installation/usage</h2>

Clone the repo, install the dependencies with pip, set up the database and create a user:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:alexwlchan/lexies-book-tracker.git
$ cd lexies-book-tracker
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ flask db upgrade
```

Then in a Python shell:

```pycon
>>> from src import db, models
>>> user = models.User(username=USERNAME)
>>> import getpass
>>> user.set_password(password=PASSWORD)
>>> db.session.add(user)
>>> db.session.commit()
```

To run the app:

```console
$ pip3 install gunicorn
$ GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY="<API_KEY>" gunicorn --bind "127.0.0.1:8000" -w 4 src:app
```

This will start the app running on <http://localhost:8000>.

I am **not supporting** this app.
You are welcome to run it yourself, but the only instance I'm interested in is the one I run for myself.
Do not ask me for troubleshooting advice.



<h2 id="interesting">Interesting pieces (aka what to copy)</h2>

*   I'm using the autolink and smartypants libraries to turn user-supplied text into a slightly prettier representation when rendered as HTML.

    For example, when I'm recording a book I want to read, I might link to a tweet or blog post that suggested it.
    These two libraries give me nice typography (smartypants) and turn that link into a `<a>` tag that I can click.

*   The isbnlib library means I don't have to worry about the display logic for ISBNs.

*   betamax is a library for recording interactions with requests, and replaying them in tests -- I don't have to create mocks, I record real responses!

    When I'm making real requests, I send my Google Books API key, which I don't want to check into a public repo.
    If you look in `tests/conftest.py`, you can see how I'm sanitising the recorded interactions, so they only contain `<API_KEY>`, not my real key.
