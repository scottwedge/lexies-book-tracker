## Why?

GitHub has [a contract with ICE](https://github.com/drop-ice/dear-github-2.0), which is a terrible organisation responsible for numerous human rights violations.
This makes me uncomfortable using GitHub, so I'm slowly moving my personal projects away from here, and on to a self-hosted [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) instance.
